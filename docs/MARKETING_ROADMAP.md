# Marketing Roadmap for Sheety CRM

A comprehensive checklist of organic marketing strategies to drive growth for Sheety CRM. Focus on low-cost, high-impact tactics suited for an open-source tool targeting solopreneurs.

## Phase 1: Content & Lead Magnets
Build authority and capture organic traffic through high-value educational resources.
